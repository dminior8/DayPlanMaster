## Technologies

- **Spring Boot:** The application is built using the Spring Boot framework for rapid development and easy configuration.

- **Hibernate:** Hibernate is utilized for seamless data persistence, allowing the app to interact with a relational database.

- **Thymeleaf (for server-side templating):** Thymeleaf is used to create dynamic server-side templates for rendering views.

- **Spring MVC:** The Model-View-Controller architecture is employed for a structured and modular development approach.

## Future Plans

1. **Frontend Integration with React:** In the future, I plan to enhance the user interface by integrating React for a more dynamic and responsive frontend.

2. **Security Implementation with Spring Security:** To ensure the safety and privacy of user data, I will implement Spring Security for robust authentication and authorization.
